Q1: clone sets the origin variable to represent the remote repository on github that the project and folder was originally cloned from. This makes it easier to represent. 
Q2: This sets the main branch as the upstream branch. Remote tracking means that the upstream branch is being tracked on the remote repository by your local branch.
Q3: It creates a new commit that merges the two branches together. Does not change the master branch but merges the main branch into the current branch. 
Q4: no they are not
Q5: this is a merge
Q6: the local branches are updated to the origin.
